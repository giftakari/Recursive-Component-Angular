- This application uses the concepts of recursion to build a re-useable component

##### In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.

##### The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.

# Problem

- Create a dynamic component that renders nested children in JSON to same as Gmail, YahooMail and File Folder strutures

# Solution

- This project uses the concepts of Recursio and Recursive Attributes to create a Recursive Component (recursive Dynamic Components ) Live Demo:
- Angular solution https://adoring-lamport-2cb5ae.netlify,
- https://github.com/giftakari/Recursive-Component-Angular

- React Solution https://unruffled-keller-f77fa7.netlify.app/

# RecursiveComponent

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
